### `/downloads`

### `/plays`

### Options

For each of theses endpoints you can add the following paths (in any order):

**License:**

    /license/:license

Filter by license. Those are the known licenses at this time (more may have been added to the site, you can pass them to this api):

 - Licence art libre (`ART-LIBRE`)
 - Creative Commons Attribution (`CC-BY`)
 - Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial (`CC-BYNC`)
 - Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivative (`CC-BYNCND`)
 - Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike (`CC-BYNCSA`)
 - Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative (`CC-BYND`)
 - Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike (`CC-BYSA`)
 - Creative Commons Public Domain (`CC0`)

**Mood:**

    /mood/:mood

Filter by mood. Those are the known moods at this time (more may have been added to the site, you can pass them to this api):

 - `angry`
 - `bright`
 - `calm`
 - `dark`
 - `dramatic`
 - `funky`
 - `happy`
 - `inspirational`
 - `romantic`
 - `sad`

**Genre:**

    /genre/:genre

Filter by genre. Values passed will be used directly by the scrapper.

Genre, mood and license can also be passed as query params to the endpoint (e.g. `/latest?license=cc-by`). If you pass one of these both as a query param and as a url path, the url path will have priority over the query param.

For each of theses you can pass a value not listed here and the scrapper will try to get the music if there's any corresponding one.
